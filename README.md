# Security-System-with-Arduino-and-NodeMCU

I have made this with arduino and also with NodeMCU

# Part 1
I have made a very basic security system with the help of Arduino, IR Sensor & Servo Motor. For simplicity purpose I have only connected one IR Sensor and one Servo Motor. If want we can interface as many as we want according to the arduino board that we select, due to the pin configurations.

# Part 2
I also made the same project with the help of the NodeMCU, with which we can control the sensors via web servers. I have given the options to control both the sensors by just clicking the button the web page.
